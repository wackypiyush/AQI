# Air Quality Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of air quality data in India. The dataset used in this project contains information about various air pollutants measured in different cities across India.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [Air Quality Data in India (2015 - 2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india).

## Important Insights

### 1. Air Quality Trends Over Time
   - Utilizing time series analysis, we observe the temporal variations in air quality parameters, identifying trends and seasonality.

### 2. Correlation Analysis
   - Explore correlations between different pollutants to understand how they co-vary, providing insights into potential sources of pollution.

### 3. Anomalies and Outliers
   - Identify and analyze anomalies and outliers in the dataset, understanding their impact on air quality calculations.

### 4. Pre and Post-COVID Analysis
   - Investigate changes in air quality patterns before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, exploring the impact of lockdowns and reduced human activities.


## Instructions
1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Explore the findings and visualizations to gain insights into air quality trends in India.
